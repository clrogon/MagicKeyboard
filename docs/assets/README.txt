NOTICE:
Do not place binary image files in this folder if you are using an AI-based coding environment that syncs the filesystem. 
They will be deleted on the next sync because the AI cannot "hold" the binary data in its memory.

Recommended Solution:
1. Upload your screenshots to an external image host (Imgur, GitHub Issues, AWS S3).
2. Use the direct URL to the image in the Markdown files (README.md, etc.).
3. We are currently using placehold.co URLs as placeholders to prevent broken links.
